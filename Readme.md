# WeRateDogs Twitter Archive Dataset
Here, we discuss the data wrangling efforts that were undertaken to clean and prepare the WeRateDogs dataset for analysis.

## Data Sources
The dataset consists of three tables:

twitter_archive_enhanced.csv - Contains the basic tweet information, including the tweet ID, timestamp, and text.
image_predictions.tsv - Contains the image predictions for each tweet, including the predicted breed of dog and the confidence level of the prediction.
twitter_api_data.txt - Contains additional tweet information obtained through the Twitter API, including retweet count and favorite count.

## Summary of Findings
The WeRateDogs Twitter Archive dataset was initially messy and required cleaning and wrangling to prepare it for analysis. The data wrangling process involved addressing issues with data quality and tidiness, including inaccurate data types, inconsistent values, missing data, and unneeded columns. The key findings from the wrangled dataset are:

- The most common dog breed in the dataset is the golden retriever.
- The tweets with the highest retweet counts tend to have more positive sentiment and include images of dogs with amusing captions.
- There is a positive correlation between the dog's rating numerator and the number of retweets and favorites.
- The most common dog stage in the dataset is pupper, followed by doggo.
